#+title: Pure Common Lisp libraries for game development

A list of libraries written in pure Common Lisp - that is, *with no foreign dependencies* - that may be of particular interest
to people developing games and similar interactive applications in Common Lisp.

You won't find libraries for pushing pixels and playing sounds here (for now). Those tend to require interfacing with a
native platform API (or a foreign, usually C, library abstracting native platform APIs). But there's still plenty you can
do without leaving the Lisp world.

* The list

  Unless otherwise stated in remarks, all libraries are available through the official Quicklisp distribution, as of =2017-11-24=.

* Motivation

  Foreign libraries involve working with, and shipping, foreign dependencies. Doing that correctly, for all important platforms, is
  a quite tricky and painful process. It can be done (see e.g. [[https://borodust.org/delivering-common-lisp][this article]] by borodust), but the less foreign libraries you have
  to deliver, the less hassle you have. Moreover, the developent process itself can get tedious - even though projects like
  [[https://github.com/rpav/cl-autowrap][cl-autowrap]] do a great job at making things easier, you might still hit a library wrapper that will require you (or people you share
  your code with!) to have a whole LLVM environment to even build the ASDF system.

  Unlike many popular dynamic languages, Common Lisp is *actually performant*, with implementations like SBCL generating code
  that can compete in speed with C (if properly written and instrumented). This opens the possibility of using pure Common Lisp code
  for interactive applications without taking a huge performance hit.

* Contributing

  If you see a library that a) can be useful in game development (or closely related areas), and b) is pure Common Lisp, i.e. has no
  foreign dependencies that need to be managed through FFI, feel free to include it and send a Pull Request.

  Corrections to any information in this list are welcome too. I have only so much patience to check e.g. licenses :).

  Also, I'm considering starting a section with usage examples for libraries that are meant to be
  used with typical foreign gamedev dependencies - e.g. how to use =pngload= to load a texture for =cl-opengl=. Any such examples
  are welcome too.
